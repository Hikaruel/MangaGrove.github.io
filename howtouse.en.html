## 📁 Book Format Requirements

### ⚠️ Important: Correct Book Structure

**Manga Grove requires "folder + image sequence" format:**

```
✅ Correct Format:
My Comics/
├── Attack on Titan Vol.1/    ← One book
│   ├── 001.jpg
│   ├── 002.jpg
│   └── 003.jpg
├── Attack on Titan Vol.2/    ← Another book
│   ├── 001.jpg
│   └── 002.jpg
└── One Piece Vol.1/
    └── ...

❌ Wrong: Don't import scattered image files directly
```

### Supported Formats

**Image Formats**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP

**Container Formats**:
- Folders (recommended)
- ZIP/CBZ archives (WiFi Transfer only)

**Not Supported**: RAR, 7z, PDF

### File Naming Recommendations

**Strongly recommend using numeric names for images:**

```
✅ Recommended:
001.jpg
002.jpg
003.jpg

❌ Avoid:
advertisement.jpg
ad.jpg
cover.jpg
```

**Why?** Numeric naming ensures:
- Correct cover selection (avoids advertisement images)
- Pages in correct order
